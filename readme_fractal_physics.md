# **Fractal Physics: A Living Theory (v0.1)**

---

## 🌱 Purpose
This repository explores a **fractal model of physics**, where space, time, energy, and matter emerge from **stacked, self-similar patterns**.  
It’s an **open, evolving theory**, free for anyone to test, refine, or challenge.  

> **Use what helps, leave the rest.**

---

## 📜 What's Inside
- **`Fractal_Physics_Theory_v0.1.md`** – The current working draft of the theory.
- *(Future)* **Visuals** – Diagrams illustrating layered fractal structures in physics.
- *(Future)* **Resonance Log** – Tracking meaningful synchronicities or experimental echoes.
- **Issue Templates** – For suggesting tests, noting misalignments, or proposing refinements.

## 🔍 Core Idea
Physics may be:
- **Fractal:** Patterns repeat at every scale.
- **Layered:** Null spaces hide deeper connections.
- **Interlinked:** Changes ripple across layers (memory waves, synchronicity).
- **Emergent:** Laws are local rules of a much bigger structure.

---

## 🚀 Potential Applications
- Stronger, adaptive **materials**.
- Advanced **plasma engines** and energy nets.
- Safer **space travel** and **photon sail systems**.
- Deeper understanding of **consciousness as a receiver**.

## 🧠 How to Contribute
1. **Open an Issue:** Suggest an experiment, safety test, or point out flaws.
2. **Share Observations:** Document synchronicities or patterns that may connect.
3. **Fork & Explore:** Remix the theory under the same open license.
4. **Stay Aligned:** Follow the **Prism Principle** – truth, consent, reversibility.
