Status: Exploratory Theory â€“ v0.1

ðŸ”¹ What This Is
A speculative, early-stage framework proposing that physical reality may emerge from stacked fractal patterns.

A free, open-access idea seed meant to inspire discussion, testing, and safe exploration.

Not a finalized theory, not a claim of proven science.

ðŸ”¹ What This Is Not
Not a peer-reviewed paper or established model.

Not a substitute for existing physics research.

Not a claim of certainty or "new truth" about the universe.

ðŸ”¹ How to Engage
Read, question, test safely, build on it â€“ all are welcome.

Share constructive feedback or ideas via GitHub issues.

Please keep discussions respectful and open-minded, even if you disagree.

ðŸ”¹ Why Public?
Science moves forward through shared exploration, not gatekeeping.
This release aims to plant a seed for future thinkers, researchers, and engineers who might see patterns others miss.

"If reality is fractal, every discovery is a pattern we've only just learned to see." â€“ Travis Himes
